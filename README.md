#🏀 NCAA March Madness Predictor README (Python Prototype) 🏀

Welcome to my program, meticulously created to boost your odds of becoming the champion in your office's NCAA March Madness betting pool. The primary functionality of this Python-based prototype is to utilize analytical data to devise the most successful bracket possible.

This Python application 🐍 ingests a CSV file 🗃 that includes ranking data from the 538's model prior to the tournament. It harnesses this data, applies the logistic equation, and calculates the win probabilities for each team 🎯.

Notably, it also factors in the contrarian method by leveraging data from ESPN's 'Who Picked Whom', adding another layer of strategic depth to your predictions.

This Python prototype, while functional, was an initial step towards a more efficient solution. It has since been replaced by a highly performant version written in Rust, capable of running millions of simulations 🔄 at lightning speed to project numerous potential outcomes of the NCAA tournament. The Rust version then pinpoints and returns the brackets with the highest scoring potential 🏆.

This Python version laid the groundwork for the next level in March Madness betting strategy. Gear up for the next March Madness pool with the more advanced, Rust-based version of this prediction software! 🚀
